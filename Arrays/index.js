// reference types : object, array, string
// they are on stack and heap memory
// for eg let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// here the arr is not a memory location, it is a reference to the memory location where the array is stored. actual data is stored in heap memory.

// Object is a collection of key-value pairs
